# AttributedString
A class to work with attributed strings in PHP. Attributed strings are strings that can have multiple attributes per character of the string. Each attribute is a bitfield (boolean array) with the length of the string. This simple data structure can be used to implement lots of interesting things like:
 * text-decorations, colors, fonts etc in a word processor (e.g. set a range of the string to have the "bold" attribute)
 * semantic text analysis systems (with attributes like "verb" and "noun")
 * core text extraction
